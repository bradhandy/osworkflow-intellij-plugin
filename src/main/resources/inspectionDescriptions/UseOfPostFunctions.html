    Unhandled exceptions in post-functions could cause inconsistent workflow state.
    <!-- tooltip end -->
    When processing a workflow, the order of execution is action>pre-functions, result>pre-functions,
    transition to next step, result>post-functions, action>post-functions.  An unhandled exception in a post-functions
    will cause the workflow to transition to the next step and skip any remaining post-functions.

    This can cause inconsistent workflow state and leave possibly critical business logic unexecuted.
