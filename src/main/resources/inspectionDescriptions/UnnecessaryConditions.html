    Identifies "conditions" elements under the root "conditions" element containing only a single child.
    <!-- tooltip end -->
    A "conditions" element, other than the root "conditions" element, having a single child provides no benefit.  Only
    the first "conditions" with a single child in a tree is marked.  The provided quick fix will traverse the tree to
    the sole "condition" tag or the first "conditions" element with more than one child.  The marked element is then
    replaced with the identified "leaf" element.
